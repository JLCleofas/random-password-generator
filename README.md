# Random Password Generator Mini Project

This password generator is a mini project for my review for the Python Certified Associate-Level Programmer.

This applies the learnings from the built-in module from Python: Random.

This application gathers initial requirments from the user:

1. The password length.
2. Has capital letters.
3. Has numbers.
4. Has special characters.
